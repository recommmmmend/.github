### **What data does robin store where and how is it encrypted?**
Your twitter oauth2 token and refresh token are stored locally to ensure security. We do store tweet data associated with your account like your username, display name and your pfp. We also store the number of tweets you tweet,like,retweet and quote tweet and for tweets we store the content of said tweets. Along with that we store engagement with said tweets for a wrapped style program. After one year any specific data is deleted. You can disable the wrapped feature if you want. ** we only store data that is from robin so any other data from other clients is not collected**. Data is stored on a firebase Project.
